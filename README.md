# KGI4NFDI 
KGI4NFDI advocates for a central and reusable Knowledge Graph Infrastructure (KGI) to enhance interoperability within the research domain and support the NFDI's objectives. It aims to provide essential components including a Knowledge Graph (KG) registry and a service for accessing KGs across NFDI projects. Additionally, the service intends to empower research communities to create decentralised KG instances using standardised approaches, technologies, and expertise. Through surveys, documentation, consulting services, and ontology harmonisation, the proposal seeks to optimise KG creation and foster standardised ontological practices, contributing to the "One NFDI" vision and promoting FAIR data principles. This initiative will complement international efforts, such as those of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), in advancing knowledge graph initiatives. See the KGI4NFDI project proposal <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13118749> for details.
